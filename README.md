In this phase, and during this process, I will strive to document and make available to you all the work I have done during the Internship offered to me by CodeAlpha. This Internship will last for three months, and I will work as a Python Developer with the CodeAlpha organization.

You can study each task separately and, if necessary, use it or share your criticisms and suggestions with me via the email address below.
